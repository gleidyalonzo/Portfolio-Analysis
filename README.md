# Portfolio Analysis Project

This project demonstrates portfolio analysis using Python. It includes data collection, performance measurement, risk assessment, optimization, and visualization.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains data files.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.
- **scripts/**: These scripts involve automating portfolio analysis tasks such as performing calculations and statistical analysis, and generating visualizations.

#### Features

Data Collection and Portfolio Sample Creation
Performance Measurement
Risk Assessment
Portfolio Optimization
Data Visualization

#### Python Packages
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy
jupyter

### Scripts

- data_collection scripts load and pre-process the stock data.
- performance measurement calculates the performance metrics of the porfolio.
- risk_assessment measures the risk on the portfolio.
- optimization performs porfolio optimazation

Usage
1. Place your stock data in the data/ directory as stock_data.csv.
2. Run the main script to execute the complete analysis:

```

python main.py

```

This structure allows for a modular and organized approach to portfolio analysis, making each aspect of the analysis reusable and easier to maintain.
